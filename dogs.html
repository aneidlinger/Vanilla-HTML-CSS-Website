                <h3>Name: Spike</h3>
                <h3>Breed: Bulldog</h3>
                <p>Cameras definitely love Spike, and he loves them in return! He loves his chew toys, and he's always talking to get your attention. Usually it's about food. Lots of treats will go a long way with Spike!</p>

                <h3>Breed: Labrador</h3>
                <p>Macy is our newest forever-home candidate. She loves chewing on things (especially pantlegs) and following people around hoping to be picked up. This little girl certainly won't stay little for long, so if you can't resist that adorable face, come adopt her quick!</p>

                <h3>Breed: Mix</h3>
                <p>This on has so much energy! Joey's favorite thing to do is play 'fetch.' In fact, the farther you throw the ball, the faster he goes. Anyone looking to make him part of their family needs to have a yard or be willing to take him to the park or beach on a regular basis. This guy needs his exercise! And, of course, he also needs his cuddles. ;-) </p>
